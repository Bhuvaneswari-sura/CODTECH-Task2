# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :
HTML Structure:
The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page, including a join screen for entering a username and a chat screen for sending and receiving messages.

CSS Styling:
The CSS file styles the chat application, making it look clean and organized with proper layout, colors, and spacing.

Client-side JavaScript:
The JavaScript file handles the functionality on the client side. It manages user interactions like joining the chat, sending messages, and displaying messages.

Server-side Code:
The server-side code, written in Node.js, uses Express to serve the static files and Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the server. It handles events like a user joining, sending messages, and disconnecting.

Real-time Communication:
When a user joins or sends a message, Socket.io handles the real-time communication, broadcasting these events to all connected users.

By combining these components, the project creates a functional real-time chat application where multiple users can join and communicate instantly
